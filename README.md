This project from GameDev.tv is the combat system for a third person RPG inspired by games like Diablo 3. 
The tutorial series focused on introducing many Unity and programming elements such as raycasting, interfaces, action schedulers, and delegates. 
Elements from other tutorials such as coroutines, scriptable objects, and prefabs were covered in more depth as well. 
This series also had a heavier focus on game design fundamentals, discussing ideas such as dependency charts, GDDs, and progression spreadsheets.
